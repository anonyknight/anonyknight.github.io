## Software vulnerabilities and how attackers exploit them

Buffer overflow

Stacks are used

* Function/procedure calls
* allocation of memory for
  * local variables
  * parameters
  * control information (return address)

## Security programming

* code "defensively", expecting it to be exploited;
* do not trust the user "input".
