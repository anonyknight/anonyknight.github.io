## Java Family Kotlin vs Groovy

## **Kotlin** - Teamcity IaC

started in 2012, a high-level, statically typed programming language that runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can be compiled to [JavaScript source code](https://www.educba.com/cheat-sheet-javascript/) or handle the LLVM compiler infrastructure.

Improvement: [null safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html) or[operator overloading](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/operator-overloading.html) . Kotlin is much appreciated by developers for its interoperability, code security, and accuracy.

### Groovy - Jenkins IaC

It combines **static typing** for Java and more relaxed **dynamic typing** similar to Python. It can be used as both programming language and scripting language. Groovy enables to write scripts besides classes, perfect fit for frequent changed tasks. That's probably the reason why Jenkins pipeline plug-in uses Groovy.

Improvement: [safe navigation operator](http://groovy-lang.org/operators.html#_safe_navigation_operator) (?.), the concept of [Closures](http://groovy-lang.org/closures.html), [Traits](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/next/html/documentation/core-traits.html), runtime dispatching of methods, [Groovy String](https://causecode.com/groovy-string-interpolation/), Array initialization and many others.
