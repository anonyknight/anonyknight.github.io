## Gatech [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/)

I joined Gatech OMSCS program in 2021 Spring. Here are my study and notes of the program.

Here are more [class notes](../docs/category/omscs).

## Why OMSCS?

Students may have different reasons to join this program.

* Learning advanced knowledge and skills for career development
* Explore more opportunities in different concentrations.
* Switch majors from other fields into computer sciences.

I was for the first and second reasons.

An article (joint with Professor Zvi Galil our former Dean) on the backstory of
creating the OMSCS program appeared as a cover story in the October issue of CACM
entitled “Creating a revolutionary new academic program”.
